<h1> 👋 Hey folks! I'm Jim. </h1>

I'm a founder and software engineer based on Greece.

In the past decade, I've spent time as a design and software engineering contractor. I'm strongest within the React JS and UI design ecosystem.

Also, I've co-founded VisualEyes, a venture-backed startup that provides deep AI design analytics for clients including Airbnb, HP, Mailchimp. My work in VisualEyes includes setting up the frontend infrastructure and then managing the product team.

I'm passionate about blogging, public learning, and bootstrapping.
